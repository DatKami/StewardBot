Gather the required dependencies by running this command where you install the bot:

`npm update --save`

Edit the credentials in the config/config.js. Add the id of the users that can setup the bot in config/admins. Then run using

`node johnbot.js`

Make sure the account the bot is running is already added to a server you have access to, then type !setup to set that bot in the text channel and the voice channel you're in.

To use the youtube features, add your api-key to config/googleapikey.txt.
